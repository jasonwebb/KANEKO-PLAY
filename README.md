# KANEKO - PLAY exhibition
Source code, design files, BOMs, build notes, photos and videos for all pieces I built for the 2015 PLAY exhibition at KANEKO in Omaha, NE.

## Minecraft interface
* Interactive dirt block - a 2x2x2' cube painted to look like a dirt block, outfitted with a piezo transducer to detect when you hit it. A Teensy detects hits to the box and clicks the left mouse button in-game.
* Movement pad - a 4x4' directional pad to detect a player's steps and press corresponding movement keys (WASD) in-game.
* Jump pad - a 2x2' pad to detect jumps from the player and translate them into jumps in-game (Space).
* Aiming joystick - an old joystick retrofitted to move the mouse up and down to allow players to aim in-game.

## Interactive moving lights
A series of three interactive RGB LEDs attached to pan/tilt mechanisms and paired with colorful control panels. As the control panels are manipulated, the LEDs move and change colors in strange ways.

* Blue panel - circular laser-cut panel with four large dome buttons and a classic arcade joystick
* Yellow panel - triangular laser-cut panel with three banks of buttons and toggle switches.
* Red panel - square panel with a circular softpot, two pushbuttons and a plant outfitted with piezo transducers to detect hits.
